##About
I built this prortfolio for multiple reasons.
First of all, I need my own site to showcase what I can do, a way for you to contact me, and to tell the world a little bit about myself. Second, I needed to drastically improve my vanilla CSS skills. Thirdly, I wanted a site live, with my own DN, and hosted on a server, and to set that all up myself.

##Tech Used

1. JavaScript
2. CSS
3. HTML

##To Do's

1. Continuous improvements and redesign to CSS and web layout for optimal UX.
